🎯 Concept
“We developed an interactive website based on the keywords vault, cloud, and hot, where the user must type falling cloud-like words correctly to prevent temperature rise and unlock the vault.”

👉 Step-by-step:
Words appear like clouds
user types them
If correct → continue
If missed → temperature increases 🔥
If all words typed → vault opens 🔐
